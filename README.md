# Book Tracking

## Description
This is a React application which tracks the books which are either read, currently being read or wanted to be read. The user can change "the state" or the shelf of a specific book. Also the user can search for books and add them to different shelves. Because of the constraints imposed by the API used in this app, which is the API provided by udacity, only specific terms can be used in the search. These terms are mentioned in **SEARCH_TERMS.md**

## Usage
run `npm install` and then `npm start`. You will find the app running on localhost:3000
